Hello tester

The folder named 

node_modules.zip

contains all the required modules to run the scripts. 

Extract it into the folder you will be running the scripts from.

Several of the exercises requires the trainee to use SQL script files they have created, 
I have placed a copy of the file in each of the folders they are required. 
The file I created in my testing is named 

PracticeDatabase 20190926a.sql

You may want to use the file you created instead.

Thank you

Tom
